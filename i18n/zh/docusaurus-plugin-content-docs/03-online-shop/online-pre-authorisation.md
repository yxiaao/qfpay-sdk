## Common APIs
Instructions on general integration with the development environment is available on [https://sdk.qfapi.com/#introduction](../preparation/introduction)

For instance you may find the following useful before you start the integration:

- API credentials to be used
- testing environments
- signature generation for api requests
- Common error codes

You can also find common APIs that are also applicable to pre-authorisation payments: 

- Transaction Enquiry (https://sdk.qfapi.com/?python#transaction-enquiry)
- Transaction Refunds (https://sdk.qfapi.com/?python#refunds)

## Creating and capturing payments

![Pre-authorisation payment flow](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/XOynJWKX441xJZ6r2HUmCDzu0HihOp61mIM1WSpE57fwTv4biJ0_eHZ8UpouxOgYLelRSYIWslKB8kr1SjVSsBq_V83tJ_0gz6owDSdV51-X2tcSUpn1m33uFzmmNx2hoIc5t-b_z8sJ48s0pN72SAnafG3MPgoEcn8KIWejhOBRhVSc2Xr5CvOhw8WZd8Qxo54xlhOExjU5AcRE_0dSs8VfpVU0M_Aw-dPKhPOV)

### Step 1: Create Pre-Authorisation Payment

The Pre-authorisation Step has to be achieved using the Payment Element component. For details of the integration, please refer to the respective sessions in the payment element documentation.

## Refunding Completed (`CAPTURED`) Transactions

For integration, please refer to the "Common API" section of the documentation. Please note that the syssn used in the refund transaction should correspond to the syssn returned upon the /authtrade request.


## Notifications

General notification rule applies. For details, please refer to the Asynchronous Notifications section in the documentations (https://sdk.qfapi.com/?python#asynchronous-notifications)

Upon successful execution of the following actions, you should be able to receive a notification

- payment completion (captured)
- unfreeze funds
- refund


These notifications will follow the same format as below. For different notification, the value of the field `notify_type` will differ

| Action Completed | notify_type value |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Payment Captured | payment |
| Unfreeze funds | unfreeze |
| Refund | refund |
